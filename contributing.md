### Spread the word

The biggest way you can help with Satchel is very simple — tell your friends about it. Open source projects live and die by their community, and Satchel is still very young. [Tweet about it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Satchel%2C%20CSS%20superpowers&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatchel.style&hashtags=css), [star it on Github](https://github.com/radioactivepesto/satchel/stargazers), and pass it around. We'd _really_ appreciate it. 

### Open an issue

If you’ve noticed a bug with Satchel, or think there’s a feature that should be included, open an issue against the [Github Repository](https://github.com/radioactivepesto/satchel/issues). Before opening an issue, search through both open and closed issues to make sure one doesn’t already exist or has been previously addressed.

When creating an issue, try to be as detailed as possible. If you’re reporting a bug, list steps to reproduce the problem and the expected outcome. If you’re suggesting a feature, explain the use-case it solves and why it would be a good fit for Satchel.

### Submit a PR

If there’s an existing issue you’d like to solve, we’d love your help! Fork the [Github repository](https://github.com/radioactivepesto/satchel) and open a pull request.

Before submitting a PR make sure you’re either addressing an open issue, or have previously discussed the feature or code you’re adding. That way we make sure that your hard work won’t go to waste in case we can’t accept the PR.
